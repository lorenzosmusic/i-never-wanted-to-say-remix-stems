## What are stems you might ask?

Stems consist of all of the instrument tracks of a recorded song that can be used for a mix. You bring them into your software and you have the original song all arranged for you to work with.

Examples - there is an audio file for the bass part, an audio file for the guitar, vocals, drums, and so on.

## Are you a github user? (optional)

**This part is NOT required to remix the song.** I just thought it would be an interesting way to collaborate.

For those that use github.com, you can clone this project to use the files if you would like.

```
Open up a terminal
git clone https://github.com/lorenzosmusic/i-never-wanted-to-say-remix-stems.git
```

When you are done you could add your remix to the `remixes` folder and submit a `pull request` and once approved we would add it to the project.
